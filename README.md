This project was created following Akshay Rana's blog "How to build a simple game in React Native". That blog post can be found on the following link:https://blog.logrocket.com/react-native-game-development-tutorial/. This project was my introduction to React Native. It was also my first time creating a mobile app and creating a mobile game. 

While running this application, I have found that the "food" sometimes lands on the snake's tail. This is probably an easy fix. I also want to change the layout of this application so that the controls section is gone and the user swipes on the screen to move the snake. This will also allow the gameboard screen to occupy more space which can allow me to include more features to the game such as obstacles. I also want to come back and improve the snake itself and give it more "skins".
